<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://pearlcapital.com/mca-sales-tools/iso-webinars/referrals-for-your-iso-business-webinar-clip/">Why Are Referrals For Your ISO Business So Valuable? [WEBINAR CLIP]</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://pearlcapital.com">Pearl Capital</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaining new clients through referrals is universal across the financial services industry. Any financial professional will tell you they get their business through referrals. So why not make it a part of your marketing strategy as an ISO? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many ISOs are still operating on an “old school” sales approach of dialing for dollars, email marketing to massive purchased lists, and pledging their allegiance to The Law of Numbers. But financial marketing expert </span><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikelangford2/">Mike Langford</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> believes referrals should become a valuable part of your business, and here’s why. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a study by Nielson, prospects are four times more likely to buy from someone they have been referred to by a friend or family member. Four times! Think about that – if a two new leads came in, one from a referral and one from your web form, the one from the referral is four times more likely to convert than that one that came in through your website. That’s some powerful odds!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason behind this is simple: when a lead comes in via a referral, the referrer (recommender) has already warmed up that lead. They’ve done the base level pre-qualification for you by being familiar with MCA and thinking that this other business owner they know would be a good fit. By the time you see the new lead, they most likely already have an idea of how an MCA works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fostering referrals creates a win-win relationship between you and your referral partner – especially if you offer a referral fee (which you probably should). Even if you’re paying a fee, it will most likely cost you less than a deal acquired via another channel like </span><strong><a href="https://pearlcapital.com/mca-sales-tools/iso-webinars/craft-effective-social-media-ad-campaigns-iso-business/">social media campaigns</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or Google. Especially when you pay the fee only upon the successful completion of the deal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information on referrals and why they’re great for MCA, check out our full webinar “</span><a href="https://pearlcapital.com/mca-sales-tools/iso-webinars/create-steady-flow-referrals-iso-business-webinar/"><b>How to Create a Steady Flow of Referrals for Your ISO Business </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positioning yourself as an ISO that has the ability to fund large merchant deals is one of the most important things you can do to see a boost in your business. But when going through a list of leads, how can you tell which merchants are most likely to need larger funding amounts? Look out for businesses that have more than one location, long business cycles, are seasonal in nature, and sell via invoice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also clues as to when is a good time to approach merchant leads with the offer of a merchant cash advance. At the macro (industry/economic) level, look out for things like new competitors or industries like new home construction and auto sales. At the micro (business) level, look out for stalled construction or clearance sales. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next Steps to Set Yourself Up for Big Deals</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Utilize a CRM, and make sure it’s one that you’ll actually use. Hubspot offers a free Sales solution that may be a good start.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">– Set up Google Alerts for industry specific news that may affect your focus verticals.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">– Start looking at sites like Nextdoor (local business section), industry specific publications and forums, and subscribe to company updates from your merchants.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">– Add company owners, industry influencers, and groups on social media.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about positioning yourself for larger deals in our webinar, </span><a href="https://pearlcapital.com/mca-sales-tools/iso-webinars/land-larger-deals/"><b>“Adopting a Hunter’s Mindset”</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>If you're looking to increase the flow of traffic to your ISO website, there are better options than calling overused UCC leads lists. Mike Langford breaks down the reasons you might want to advertise your business on Google, Facebook, Twitter, and more and what the benefits of each are in this clip.</p>

[WEBINAR CLIP]</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://pearlcapital.com">Pearl Capital</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What marketing works best for MCA: social media or Adwords? It’s the age old question for ISOs. Whether you read </span><strong><a href="https://debanked.com/2017/09/the-google-battle-for-lending-and-smb-finance-keywords/">deBanked</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, talk with other ISOs, or go to industry events this is sure to be mentioned. In this clip from our webinar “</span><strong><a href="https://pearlcapital.com/mca-sales-tools/iso-webinars/craft-effective-social-media-ad-campaigns-iso-business/">How To Craft Effective Social Media Ad Campaigns For Your ISO Business</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">”, financial marketing expert </span><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikelangford2/">Mike Langford</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tackles the topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Adwords and social media ads have their pros and cons. Google Ads have been a foundation of ISO marketing since the very beginning. The great thing about them is they are shown to an audience based on expressed or inferred intent. Adwords gives you the ability to target based on location, language, keywords, and more. If strategically used, Google Ads can be a great marketing tool for ISOs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is that most of the time ISOs can’t figure out the ‘special sauce’ when it comes to Google Ads. Because merchants find your ads based on keywords like “merchant cash advance” and “business funding”, you miss out on the merchants who may be looking for financing but have no clue a merchant cash advance even exists. For that reason, and for notoriously high CPCs, Langford leans towards the other option – social media ads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefit of using social media ads is the ability to define your audience in an extremely granular way (example: 35 year old men who own businesses in Texas who make $20k or more a month in revenue). With this, you’re able to get your ad directly in front of the people you want to be in front of at what can be a significantly lower cost than Google.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, there’s no true answer to this debate. Some ISOs will find success with Adwords, while others will drain their marketing budgets trying to figure it out. Some ISOs will find their golden ticket in social media ads, while others will only see an increase in “likes” but a drop in deals funded. For both social media and Adwords, it will take trial and error  to get things right. </span></p>
