										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LinkedIn is a great tool for any professional. But as an ISO, it can be an especially great way to network with potential merchants and other ISOs in the MCA business. There are two types of pages on Linkedin: a personal page and a company page. On your personal page, you have the ability to show off skills and experience to prospective connections and leads. On a company page, it&#8217;s strictly business: company size, website, updates, and contact information. For an example of this, check out the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pearlcapitalbusinessfundingllc">Pearl Capital company page</a>.</p>
<p>The infographic below will teach you how to set up your personal page and use it not just correctly, but smartly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any ISO who has a business account set up on Facebook can take advantage of using lead form ads to find new MCA leads. What sets these ads apart is that a lead form ad on Facebook can be completely filled out by merchants without ever leaving the Facebook app. </span></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #601a7a;"><strong>Less Friction = More Conversions. </strong></span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When forms are easier to fill out, it’s safe to say you can expect more prospects to fill them out. Google ads require merchants to click onto a landing page to give their information. With Facebook Lead Form Ads, the entire lead capture takes place on Facebook and pulls from merchants profiles, requiring them to fill less information. Facebook lead ads allow merchant prospects to request information on your MCA funding options directly within the Facebook platform.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1298 size-full" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/FB-Phone-GIF.gif" alt="iso-mca-lead-form-ad" width="480" height="364" /></span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Set Up Your Lead Form Ad on Facebook</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before getting started, be sure you have administrative access your Facebook business page. You will also need your ISO website privacy policy URL and some images to make your ad stand out. Now, let’s get started with creating your ad:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1344 size-full" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-01.jpg" alt="iso-mca-facebook-ads-manager" width="940" height="155" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-01.jpg 940w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-01-300x49.jpg 300w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-01-768x127.jpg 768w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-01-900x148.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Facebook, open the power editor or ads manager tool for your business page. If you choose ads manager, click &#8220;Create Ad&#8221;. If you choose power editor, click &#8220;Create Campaign&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1332 size-full" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-02.jpg" alt="iso-mca-facebook-ads-objective" width="776" height="465" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-02.jpg 776w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-02-300x180.jpg 300w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-02-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 776px) 100vw, 776px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The screen you see next will ask what your objective is for the new campaign. For Lead Form Ads, click, &#8220;lead generation&#8221;. The page will then show the next option:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1333 size-full" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-03.jpg" alt="iso-mca-facebook-ads-campaign-name" width="717" height="443" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-03.jpg 717w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-03-300x185.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Name your ad campaign something you’ll remember (“Healthcare Merchant Leads 2018” or “Spring ‘18 Merchants”). For this example, we will name it &#8220;Facebook Lead Ads Test&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1334 size-full" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-04.jpg" alt="iso-mca-facebook-ads-account-info" width="760" height="377" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-04.jpg 760w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-04-300x149.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it’s time to set your account details like what country you’re in, your timezone, and what ad unit currency you’ll use. Note: this step is part of setting up your actual business ads account, not your individual ad.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1346" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-05-1.jpg" alt="" width="739" height="282" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-05-1.jpg 739w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-05-1-300x114.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Select your ISO page from the drop-down menu and accept the terms and conditions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1336 size-full" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-06.jpg" alt="iso-mca-facebook-audience-selection" width="679" height="692" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-06.jpg 679w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-06-294x300.jpg 294w" sizes="(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set up merchant targeting for your ad. You can customize your audience using triggers like age, gender, or location. To use a </span><strong><a href="https://pearlcapital.com/mca-sales-tools/iso-guides/guide-to-custom-merchant-audiences-iso/">custom audience of merchants</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you’ve already created, click “Used a Saved Audience”. Notice the gauge on the right that shows the total size of the audience and how it changes as you set different specifications.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1337 size-full" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-07.jpg" alt="iso-mca-facebook-ad-placement" width="714" height="345" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-07.jpg 714w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-07-300x145.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose whether you want Facebook  to automatically show the ad where it&#8217;s most likely to perform best, or if you&#8217;d rather choose the placement yourself based on customized preferences. We recommend using automatic placement by Facebook, especially if this is your first lead form ad.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1338 size-full" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-08.jpg" alt="iso-mca-facebook-ad-schedule" width="525" height="368" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-08.jpg 525w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-08-300x210.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much are you willing to spend on your ad? This is where you’ll set your budget. Ads on Facebook work like an auction. Most ISOs have experimented with AdWords in the past to find new MCA leads and have an idea how how much they spent. If that’s you, price with that number in mind. When setting your budget, it&#8217;s always important to remember what the overall <a href="https://pearlcapital.com/mca-sales-tools/newsletters/value-of-marketing-iso-business/">value of marketing</a> is to your ISO business. In order to see a true return, you&#8217;ll need to be ready to put some money into the machine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1339 size-full" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-09.jpg" alt="iso-mca-facebook-ads-media" width="909" height="665" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-09.jpg 909w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-09-300x219.jpg 300w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-09-768x562.jpg 768w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-09-900x658.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 909px) 100vw, 909px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Select an ad layout format on the next screen and upload your creative to make the ad stand out. Don&#8217;t be afraid to test out different options and layouts to learn what works best over time. You can choose to have one image, multiple images, a video, or even a slideshow.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1340 size-full" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-10.jpg" alt="iso-facebook-preview-ad" width="673" height="698" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-10.jpg 673w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-10-289x300.jpg 289w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s time to create and customize the most important part of your ad – the form. First, choose your headline, your ad text, and CTA for the ad’s display page. Be specific in your text! Merchants should know exactly what they’re signing up for when they click the CTA of your ad. The two CTAs that probably best fit your desired action for merchants are  “Apply Now” or “Learn More”.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1341 size-full" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-11.jpg" alt="iso-facebook-image-headline" width="745" height="535" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-11.jpg 745w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-11-300x215.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now think about what information you’re hoping to collect from your MCA leads and add them in the &#8220;questions&#8221; tab. Only ask the questions you really need to know up front. Questions like “What is your monthly gross income?” or “How many years have you been in business?” are important for ISOs to ask. As we talked about before, the more questions you have, the lower your CTR (click through rate) will likely be. Keep it short and sweet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: Not only can you request name, phone number, and email address, but you can also ask open-ended questions. Things like “How do you plan on using your advance?” might be worth asking up front.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1342 size-full" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-12.jpg" alt="iso-facebook-ad-privacy-policy" width="745" height="503" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-12.jpg 745w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-12-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because a privacy policy ensures the security of the merchant’s information, adding your privacy policy to your ad is extremely important. Paste the link to your ISO website’s privacy policy and place any additional disclaimers to the ad here. Facebook&#8217;s required disclaimer also will appear below the form.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1343 size-full" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-13.jpg" alt="iso-facebook-ad-thank-you-screen" width="749" height="474" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-13.jpg 749w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lead-for-application-steps-13-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it’s time to create the screen merchants will see after the submit the form – The Thank You Screen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip: Add your ISO website link here so the merchant can easily visit your site after form submission. </span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check over your ad to make sure everything looks good and click &#8220;finish”. (Note: you can &#8220;select a CRM&#8221; like Hubspot if you want to collect submission information in the Leads Setup section). Click &#8220;Place Order&#8221; and voila – you are all set.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Should An ISO Advertise on Facebook?</span></h2>
<p>Not only is Facebook the most popular social network across the board, it&#8217;s also extremely popular among small businesses. What does that mean? It&#8217;s also a great place for an ISO to reach potential merchants! While setting up an <strong><a href="https://pearlcapital.com/mca-sales-tools/iso-webinars/craft-effective-social-media-ad-campaigns-iso-business/">ad campaign</a></strong> on Facebook can be daunting at first, it&#8217;s actually quite easy to do. The real question is: what type of ad should you run. As a MCA funder, us at Pearl Capital have run quite a few Facebook ads before. That&#8217;s why we are confident in rating our top ad types for any ISO looking to leverage paid ad campaigns to find new leads. Here are our top ads in order of usefulness and the unique specs each ad type requires:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Best Facebook Ad Types For ISOs</span></h3>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Facebook Lead Form Ads</span></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1298" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/FB-Phone-GIF.gif" alt="" width="480" height="364" /></p>
<p><b>Supported Platform Placements:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Desktop and Mobile Newsfeed, Audience Network, and Instagram</span></p>
<p><b>Why is this our favorite ad type for ISOs? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">With PPC/Google Ads at such a high cost for the MCA industry, Facebook is a cheaper alternative and can be just as effective. The beauty of a Facebook Lead Ad is you can collect all the information you need all on one platform. Unlike Google Adwords, which requires a user to click onto a landing page and fill out a form, this is a seamless process &#8211; allowing users to fill out the form all inline to the ad. Set up the form to ask for the information you need as an ISO. Create fields asking for merchants’ industry, monthly revenue, and years in business. You can then export the collected leads directly from Facebook Ads Manager in the form of a CSV.</span></p>
<p><b>Specs:</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Recommended Image Size:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 1,200 x 628 pixels</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Ad copy Character Limit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: 90 characters</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Headline Character Limit:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 25 characters</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Link Description Character Limit: 30 characters</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Context Card Headline Character Limit: 60 characters</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Context Card Button Character Limit: 30 characters</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Privacy Policy and website URL links are required to be included in the ad</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Link Click Ads</span></h2>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fb-link-click-ad.jpg" alt="" width="668" height="609" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fb-link-click-ad.jpg 668w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fb-link-click-ad-300x274.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" /></span></h1>
<p><b>Supported platform placements: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right column, Desktop and Mobile Newsfeed, Audience Network, and Instagram</span></p>
<p><b>What is it? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Link Click Ad is the most common ad you see on Facebook. The point of a Link Click Ad is in the name – you have a link that you want users to click. With this type of ad, you can promote your website to merchants in the hopes they will click your call-to-action and go to the site. Examples of CTA’s for these ads would be “Sign Up” if you want them to join your email list, “Learn More” if you want them to click to learn more about MCA, or “Apply Now” if you want them to click onto a landing page containing a lead form. </span></p>
<p><b>Specs: </b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Image Size Recommendation: 1,200 x 628 pixels</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Ad Copy Limit: 90 characters</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Headline Character Limit: 25 characters</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Link Description Character Limit: 30 characters</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Page Like Ads</span></h2>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fb-page-like-ad.jpg" alt="" width="618" height="627" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fb-page-like-ad.jpg 618w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fb-page-like-ad-296x300.jpg 296w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></span></h1>
<p><b>Supported Platform Placements:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Right Column, Desktop and Mobile Newsfeed</span></p>
<p><b>What is it? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re just starting out with advertising on Facebook, this is a great place to start. The purpose of a Page Like Ad is to gain more likes from target merchants for your ISO company page. More likes = more eyeballs to any content you post. Keep in mind while running Page Like Ads that it’s not about the quantity of likes you get, but the quality. Target your advertising or <strong><a href="https://pearlcapital.com/mca-sales-tools/iso-webinars/use-custom-merchant-lists-for-social-media-ads-webinar-clip/">use custom merchant lists</a> </strong>to ensure you’re creating a community of merchants you really want to be in front of, not just any business owner on Facebook.</span></p>
<p><b>Specs:</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Recommended resolution: 1,200 px x 628 px</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Text Character Limit: 125 characters</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Headline Character Limit: 25 characters</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Link Description Character Limit: 30 characters</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Boosted Page Posts</span></h2>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fb-boosted-page-ad.jpg" alt="" width="657" height="629" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fb-boosted-page-ad.jpg 657w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fb-boosted-page-ad-300x287.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px" /></span></h1>
<p><b>Supported Platform Placements: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Desktop and Mobile Newsfeed, Audience Network, and Instagram</span></p>
<p><b>What is it?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A boosted post is just like any other Facebook post you would make, but with a “Sponsored” tag at the top of the ad. Essentially, you are paying to put more eyeballs on any post you make. It’s very hard to get people to organically see your regular posts, so paying a little to boost it will make a difference.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did You Know:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Organic posts isn’t enough anymore. In fact, due to recent Facebook updates, the usual post on your page will only organically reach an average of 2-3% of your fan base (<a href="https://adespresso.com/guides/facebook-ads-beginner/facebook-ads-types/">AdEspresso</a>)</span></p>
<p><b>Specs:</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Recommended Image Size: 1,200 x 628 pixels</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Ad Copy Limit: No limit</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Headline Character Limit: 25 characters</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Link Description Character Limits: 30 characters</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Carousel Ads</span></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1297" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/FB-carousel.gif" alt="" width="408" height="641" /></p>
<p><b>Supported Platform Placements:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Desktop and Mobile Newsfeed, Audience Network, and Instagram</span></p>
<p><b>What is it? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carousel Ads allows you to put up to 10  images or videos in one single post. For ISOs this is a great opportunity to show the different financing options available to merchants or  different reasons a small business may need MCA. </span></p>
<p><b>Specs:</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Recommended Image Size: 1080 x 1080 px or 600 x 600 px</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Ad copy Character Limit: 90 characters</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Headline Character Limit: 25 characters</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Link Description Character Limits: 30 characters</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Video Ads</span></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1306" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fb-video-ad.jpg" alt="" width="638" height="651" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fb-video-ad.jpg 638w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fb-video-ad-294x300.jpg 294w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" /></p>
<p><b>Supported platform placements: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Desktop and Mobile Newsfeed, Audience Network, and Instagram</span></p>
<p><b>What is it? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video Ads are just like the Link Click Ads, but instead of promoting a link and still image you are promoting a video in your ad. ISOs can find success in promoting videos that relate to small business owners’ struggles (like how to hire new employees), or an educational video on merchant cash advance and other financing solutions. </span></p>
<p><b>Specs: </b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Ad Copy Limit: 90 characters</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Supported Aspect Ratios: 16:9 to 9:16</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– File Size Limit: up to 4 GB</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Continuous looping is available</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Video can be up to 120 min, but top-performing videos are mostly in the 15-30 sec range</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><span style="color: #601a7a;">Facebook Ad Custom Audiences</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When advertising on Facebook, you probably know that you’re able to narrow in on all kinds of demographic and geographic triggers (like “business owners in NY, NJ, and FL”). But did you know you can also target actual merchants that have interacted with your ISO business before? This is done using the custom audience creator in the Facebook audience manager.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook currently offers six custom targeting options: Customer File, Website Traffic, Engagement, Offline Activity, App Activity, and Events. To find these custom targeting options on your Ads Manager in Facebook, go to the Audiences Tool and click “create custom audience.” We’ve broken down our top choices for ISOs below.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Customer File</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the customer file option, you can upload a CSV file of merchant data (email addresses, webinar attendees, etc.) and target ads to them. ISOs can utilize this option by loading up their existing</span><a href="https://pearlcapital.com/mca-sales-tools/newsletters/acquire-high-quality-leads/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">merchants leads list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and continuously advertise to that audience.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Website Visitors</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook will add people who have visited your site to this list using the Facebook Pixel. With this option, you’re able to segment the audience based on user behaviors on your website. Things like time spent on site or pages visited can all trigger future Facebook ads.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">App Activity</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even top ISOs don’t usually have apps – at least not yet. But this is a great option for businesses that do. With this targeting option, Facebook automatically builds a list based on activity users have made on your app.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Offline Activity</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This option is newly offered by Facebook. It allows you to advertise to people who have called you or made purchases in person. For ISOs it may be hard to actually utilize this option. If you have access to your CRM and can set up the API it is definitely worth trying, though.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Engagement</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook compiles a list of merchants who have already interacted with your business via any one of six ways with this ad option. Either they viewed a video, filled out a lead form ad, opened a Canvas, interacted with your page itself, or interacted with your Instagram.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Events</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you host in person ISO events or local merchant networking sessions? Then this is a good option for you. It will target merchants who have RSVP&#8217;d to or attended events you’ve promoted on Facebook.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1313" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/facebook-facts-01.jpg" alt="" width="654" height="1028" /></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><span style="color: #601a7a;">Linkedin Custom Audiences</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Targeting options based on company, industry, skills, and titles isn’t all LinkedIn offers. There are three other ways to reach merchant leads you already know about as an ISO. LinkedIn calls these “matched audiences”. They are based on re-targeted website visitors, contacts from your existing leads database, or even the decision makers (owners) of businesses you choose.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Website Visitors</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like Facebook, LinkedIn allows you to re-target any merchants who have visited or interacted with your website. Unlike Facebook, though, you don’t need to install a pixel to get started. All you need is a URL. There are 3 ways to target based on your chosen URL:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>– <span style="color: #0d1272;">Exact:</span></strong> choose this if you want to re-target to any LinekdIn member who visited the exact URL you provide (example: the */contact-us page, or */about)<br />
<strong>– <span style="color: #0d1272;">Starts With: </span></strong>choose this if you want to re-target your ads to anyone who visited any page on the site at all that starts with your root domain<br />
<strong>– <span style="color: #0d1272;">Contains: </span></strong>select this option if you want to re-target visitors to URLs that contain the specific string of characters that you provide</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Account Targeting</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reach decision-makers within your target LinkedIn accounts you provide using this option. Just upload a CSV with up to 30,000 companies and LinkedIn will find users that are a match. This is pretty ideal for ISOs who know the actual merchant company names they want to advertise to but don’t know the owner or point person to contact.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Contact Targeting</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For account targeting, you upload a CSV of companies. For contact targeting, you can upload actual names of employees at those companies. Do you have a list of merchant leads with the business owners’ emails? That would be a great fit for contact targeting. LinkedIn recommends using at least 300 contacts, but you can upload up to 300,000 at once.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #601a7a;">Twitter Custom Audiences</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tailored audiences platform on Twitter is similar to that on Facebook and LinkedIn. Below are the three types of audience lists you can create using the feature.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the web option, Twitter targets merchants that visited your ISO website, specific pages on your site, or made specific actions within your site. Similar to the Facebook Pixel, you will need to install the</span><a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/advertising/campaign-types/increase-website-traffic/how-to-setup-conversion-tracking.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter Website Tag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before you start collecting data to populate the tailored audience. Like LinkedIn, you can choose to track either website visits at an exact URL, contains URL, or all website visits.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #0d1272;">Note:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this audience is a bit more challenging to create than others. It will require you or a developer to insert the snippet of code on the website. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lists</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lists lets you create a tailored </span><a href="https://pearlcapital.com/mca-sales-tools/iso-guides/use-twitter-ads-attract-mca-leads/">Twitter</a> audience from an uploaded CSV of merchant emails, phones numbers, Twitter IDs (user IDs or usernames), or mobile ad IDs. Once you upload your CSV, Twitter will begin matching your records with any users it is able to find on Twitter.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile Apps</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the mobile apps option, you are able to track users actions on your app and add them to a custom audience list for advertising. If you already have an app for your ISO business, first of all: Congratulations, you’re ahead of the game. If not, this may become a useful audience list should you develop one in the future.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you considered using Twitter to find more MCA Leads? Twitter has 328 million active users, making it one of the biggest social media networks out there. But what separates it from platforms like Pinterest or Instagram is the fact that it works as a great way for small and medium sized businesses (SMB) to get discovered. Almost half of all Twitter users follow brands or companies. 66% of Twitter users have discovered a new small business on Twitter, and 94% plan to purchase from those SMBs they follow. </span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1250" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/twitter-users-follow-brands-or-companies.jpg" alt="twitter-users-phone" width="133" height="238" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/twitter-users-follow-brands-or-companies.jpg 1003w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/twitter-users-follow-brands-or-companies-168x300.jpg 168w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/twitter-users-follow-brands-or-companies-768x1371.jpg 768w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/twitter-users-follow-brands-or-companies-574x1024.jpg 574w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/twitter-users-follow-brands-or-companies-900x1606.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 133px) 100vw, 133px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an ISO, you are a small business – your target audience also being small businesses. That makes Twitter a great place for you to actively post and reach out to potential merchants. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as with any social media network today, organic posting and interacting simply isn&#8217;t enough. In order to take your Twitter efforts to the next level you need to pay to play. Twitter, like Facebook and LinkedIn, offers many different options when it comes to advertising and some are more useful than others for the unique needs of an ISO. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below, we will discuss our top picks for ISO businesses when advertising on Twitter. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Types Of Ads Can You Run On Twitter?</span></h3>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brand Awareness</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your goal is to increase awareness of your ISO business, you need to get as many merchants and SMB owners as you can to see your tweets. With the Brand Awareness promotion option, you set a bid amount you’re willing to pay per 1,000 impressions (CPM). Instead of paying for follows, clicks, or retweets, you will pay for impressions. Keep in mind that follows, clicks, and retweets will surely be side effects of the ad as long as your ad copy is engaging enough.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tweet Engagement</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Tweet Engagement campaigns, you are able to put your own branded content in front of your desired merchant target audience and boost overall engagement. You have the choice to either promote existing tweets that you already published organically or create specific tweets exclusive to your ad campaign. You’ll pay when people from your target audience engage with your content by liking, retweeting, or replying. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This goal will help build an engaged following, both on and off the Twitter platform. With a Follower campaign your account will be promoted across the the Twitter platform – timelines, in the “who to follow” listings, and in search results. Your account will be marked with a “promoted” tagging to let users to know it is an ad and you will pay for any follow received from your target audience.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1251" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/promoted-accounts-01.jpg" alt="twitter-users-graph" width="288" height="356" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/promoted-accounts-01.jpg 1667w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/promoted-accounts-01-242x300.jpg 242w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/promoted-accounts-01-768x950.jpg 768w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/promoted-accounts-01-827x1024.jpg 827w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/promoted-accounts-01-900x1114.jpg 900w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/promoted-accounts-01-1200x1485.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">*</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer Insight Study. Twitter + Research Now 2016</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website Clicks</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By promoting your website on Twitter, you can drive merchants to take actions on your site like reading a specific blog article or filling out a contact form. Website clicks or conversions campaigns are optimized to generate more conversions on your site from tweets that are directed towards a specific audience of your choosing (like a tailored merchant leads list or an audience based on demographics). You will also be able to feature your website using Website Cards – a format that shows a preview of your site through an image and clear call to action. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1252" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/website-cards-01.jpg" alt="website-cards-engagement" width="280" height="346" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/website-cards-01.jpg 1667w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/website-cards-01-242x300.jpg 242w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/website-cards-01-768x950.jpg 768w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/website-cards-01-827x1024.jpg 827w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/website-cards-01-900x1114.jpg 900w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/website-cards-01-1200x1485.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">*based on Twitter data</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Start Advertising on Twitter</span></h3>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Your Objective?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you understand the different ads you can create on Twitter, let&#8217;s get started with creating your first ad. First, head over to the Twitter Ads Manager and choose your campaign objective. Are you looking to create awareness of your ISO business, gain followers, promote your videos, drive website conversions, or boost engagement? Once you decide this, you’ll be ready to set up your audience.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who Is Your Audience?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the targeting features available to you on the Twitter Audiences Manager, think about who your ideal audience will be. If you’re looking to advertise to existing followers, you will choose that option in targeting. If you’re hoping to gain new merchant leads out of your advertising, you have two options. One is to target based on geographical areas, interests, or other demographic triggers. The other is to utilize Tailored Audiences, where you are able to create your own list based on your existing merchant leads list, website visitors, or email subscription list. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Do You Want to Bid?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter ads works using a bidding system, like an auction. You will need to decide how much you’re willing to pay for each desired interaction (like clicks onto your website, or new follower) before you start your campaign. The other option is to use the automatic bidding feature, which will automatically determine what the best cost of bid should be based on what your goals are and the size of your target <a href="https://pearlcapital.com/mca-sales-tools/newsletters/building-audience-for-your-iso-business/">audience</a>. Our only recommendation is if you do wish to go with the manual bid, you will need to be sure to keep an eye on the ads performance and adjust as necessary to keep cost down and get the best use of your budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Your Budget? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Kind of Creative Will You Be Using? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also think about who your audience will be. Do you want to target based on geographical areas, interests, or other demographic triggers? Or do you want to use a tailored list (we recommend this for ISOs who have an existing merchant leads list or email subscriber list). </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn, similarly to Facebook and Twitter, provides its users with a self-service solution that allows you as an ISO to launch a targeted ad campaign to merchant leads in minutes. With the LinkedIn Campaign Manager, you’re able to set your budget, choose if you’re paying for clicks or impressions, and start or pause any of your campaigns anytime. Read on to learn how to set up your LinkedIn ads to attract new merchant leads for your ISO business whether you decide to use Sponsored Content, Sponsored InMail, or Text Ads. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Ad Formats Does LinkedIn Support?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On LinkedIn, you’re able to run one or more types of ads at once. That means, for example, you could have two text ads running at the same time as an InMail retargeting ad. Before you begin creating and managing your campaigns, take a look at our breakdown of the different ad types and think about how each could work for your ISO business.</span></p>
<h5><b>Sponsored Content</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever seen a post from a company you do or don’t follow in your newsfeed on LinkedIn with a ‘Sponsored’ or ‘Promoted’’ marking under the company name? That’s Sponsored Content ad. A Sponsored Content ad can include text, video, an image, and/or links to a website of the advertiser’s choice. For ISOs, this is a great way to attract merchants to click onto a blog post or an article on your website (with a prominently featured “Contact Us” form, of course). This ad type can appear on both the desktop and mobile versions of LinkedIn.</span></p>
<h5><b>Sponsored InMail</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sponsored InMail drives and engages merchant leads by delivering personalized messages directly into their private LinkedIn inboxes. InMail messages include a greeting, CTA  button, and body text. Advertisers also have the ability to add a link and custom footer to disclose legal terms or contact information. Unlike Text Ads or Sponsored Content Ads, Sponsored InMail messages are purchased on a &#8220;cost per send&#8221; basis. What that means is you will only be charged when a message is actually delivered  to a target merchant’s inbox. </span></p>
<h5><b>Text Ads</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Text Ads are ads that appear in the top banner or right panel of many pages on the LinkedIn network. These ads can be strictly text only or also include an image, like your ISO company’s logo. When merchant leads click a Text Ad, they will be redirected to whatever page on your site that you choose. Text Ads can appear on LinkedIn via the desktop and/or mobile versions.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating Your Ads</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></h1>
<h2><strong>How to Create a Sponsored Content Ad</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you select Sponsored Content in the Ads Manager, you will have three options:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sponsor an existing update from your Company Page </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sponsor an existing update from your </span><a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/company-pages/showcase-pages"><b>LinkedIn Showcase Page</b></a></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a brand new piece of Sponsored Content that will not appear on your Company Page or Showcase Page</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recommend always creating multiple variations of Sponsored Content. That way, you’re able to compare each and see which messages get the best results and learn what resonates best with your audience. Use a variety of messages, links, photos, and images to see what works best. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve created your ad, you will be able to view a preview before saving. This is your chance to ensure everything is spelled and worded correctly. If all looks good, select the content pieces you want to promote within your campaign and click Sponsor selected. Click Next to continue (jump down this page  to “Targeting your ads” for next steps).</span></p>
<h2><strong>How to Create a Sponsored InMail Ad</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">InMail Ads work a bit differently than the others. When you select</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sponsored InMail</span><b>,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you will be able to enter a campaign name and choose the sender. The</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">first name, last name and profile image of the sender will appear alongside the message within the recipient’s inbox. Next, add your message subject line and summary. The summary gives your recipients a preview of the message even when unopened on desktop, so make sure it stands out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to crafting your message, keep in mind these tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalization is key, and adding unique elements like first name can easily be done within the editing tool</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short, impactful subject lines with a clear value proposition to the merchant are most effective</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider incorporating some of these LinkedIn recommended keywords: thanks, exclusive invitation, connect, opportunities, and  join us/me.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After you’ve crafted your email, click Next. Add your desired landing page URL (optional) and hero banner image. We suggest linking to a landing page that contains a merchant lead capture form. Click Next to continue (jump down this page  to “Targeting your ads” for next steps).</span></p>
<h2><strong>How to Create a Text Ad</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When using a Text Ad, you will need to make a decision as to where merchants will go when they click your ad. Do you want them to end up on your LinkedIn ISO Company Page, or on a specific landing page on your website? This distinction determines not only how you set up  the ad, but also how you phrase your ad copy. Once you decide what the end goal for your ad is, you will need to add:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your main image (50 pixels x 50 pixels)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A catchy headline (up to 25 characters)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">And a description (up to 75 characters)</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know? According LinkedIn, ads with images are said to drive 20% more clicks!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn makes it easy to envision what your ad will look like, as it keeps a preview of the ad on the right side of the screen the whole time. Although you have the ability to create up to 15 Text Ads at once, we suggest creating no more than 5. That way, you can more easily monitor and analyze which  headlines, descriptions, and images get the best results.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Targeting Your Ads</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’ve chosen to use Sponsored Content, Sponsored InMail, or Text Ads, selecting your audience still works the same. After following the above steps to create your ads, you will be taken to a screen that offers these specific targeting criteria options:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1246 aligncenter" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/icons-01.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/icons-01.jpg 1024w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/icons-01-300x150.jpg 300w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/icons-01-768x384.jpg 768w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/icons-01-900x450.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, there is a wide variety of criteria you have the option of using while creating your ideal audience. As you start selecting additional criteria, you will see how each filtering option affects </span>your estimated target audience <span style="font-weight: 400;">size in the right sidebar. Notice that you can also choose to target using what LinkedIn calls Audience Expansion. This feature will automatically include audiences LinkedIn has identified as similar to your merchant lists or (CUSTOM LISTS) based on behaviors, titles, and interests.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting Your Budget</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you’ve chosen and created your ad and set up your desired targeting, it is time to set the budget for your campaign. When setting your budget, you have three pay to play options. With a Sponsored InMail Ad, you will always be charged when your mail is successfully delivered to your merchant lead (this is called cost per send, or CPS). With the other ad options, you will need to decide which option makes the most sense for you: cost per click (CPC) or cost per impression (CPM).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CPC is often used in campaigns that are action-oriented – think lead generation ads or event registration. We recommend ISOs use this for any merchant lead gen ads, “contact us” ads, or webinar/event sign ups. CPM is a better fit for brand awareness campaigns, like getting your name in front of your target merchants.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1318" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/linked-in-budget.jpg" alt="" width="1385" height="757" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/linked-in-budget.jpg 1385w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/linked-in-budget-300x164.jpg 300w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/linked-in-budget-768x420.jpg 768w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/linked-in-budget-1024x560.jpg 1024w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/linked-in-budget-900x492.jpg 900w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/linked-in-budget-1200x656.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1385px) 100vw, 1385px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is during this step that you will enter your suggested bid, daily and total budget, and start and set your end date. Keep in mind that no matter what you put down as your end date, you can pause or cancel your campaign at any time. Also, know that LinkedIn’s auction system rewards engagement. That means you don’t need to be the highest bidder in order to have your ad served to leads, you just need to have a history of engaging ad content.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measuring and Optimizing Your Campaigns Once They’re Live</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To view the analytics on your campaign, go to the Campaign Manager tool on LinkedIn and select which campaigns you want to view. You should see a page similar to this: </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campaign-reporting-diagram-01-3.jpg" alt="linkedin campaign reporting diagram" width="1280" height="640" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have some fun here! After your ads have been running for a while, click through each campaign to see how the ads within the campaign are performing. Use this data to figure out what edits you should make to your ads. Based on performance, you may learn you should refine your targeting, adjust your spending, or turn ad variations on and off. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is a great platform for any ISO to advertise what alternative financing options they offer to merchants. There are 2 billion people that use Facebook every month. That makes for an amazing opportunity for you to reach your target merchants! One of the best things about utilizing Facebook Ads to target your ads in a variety of different ways. We ranked our favorites for ISOs:</p>
<h4><strong>1. Customer File</strong></h4>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Customer-File-01-1.png" alt="customer file" width="1024px" height="512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We vote this option as our favorite of the Facebook Ads custom audience options for ISOs. Nothing is more vital to a hungry ISO than a fruitful leads list. But, as you know, a stagnant leads list is nothing if it isn’t being touched by frequent calls, emails, and ads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order for this audience option to work, a good leads list must already exist.  Facebook will match every user it can find using emails, phone numbers, Facebook user IDs, or mobile advertising IDs that you upload via CSV. We at Pearl have seen a fairly high match rate with leads from Radius, Data.com, and other lead providers. We discussed </span><a href="https://pearlcapital.com/mca-sales-tools/newsletters/acquire-high-quality-leads/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to acquire a list of high quality leads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a previous webinar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loading up your existing email subscribers is a great way to utilize this option. Using any conference attendee lists that are relevant to your ISO business, and any merchants you have worked with in the past are also great places to start. </span></p>
<h4><strong>2. Website Traffic</strong></h4>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1255 size-large" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Website-Traffic-01.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have installed the </span><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/952192354843755">Facebook Pixel</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> onto your website, you will have the ability to run ads that are shown to anyone who has visited your website within any given number of days. Facebook gives you the option to choose any amount. We suggest selecting 60-90 days when creating your pixel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only can you target visitors to your website as a whole, but you also have the ability to create custom audience lists based on:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Specific web pages the viewed</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– The number of pages they viewed</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– The time they spent on your site (and more)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A custom audience based on website traffic is a smart compliment to any email lead nurturing campaigns you have set up, or Google Ads. The more eyeballs that hit your website from other sources, the better.  The power to show up in the Facebook news feed of any business owner who has visited your site is invaluable to any ISO. </span></p>
<h4><strong>3. Engagement</strong></h4>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1256 size-large" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Engagement-01.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the engagement ad targeting option, you can target users who have interacted with your Facebook or Instagram posts in the past. In order for a user to fall under this targeting, they must have interacted with your Facebook page. Users will be added to your engagement list if they: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Watched a video on your page</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Filled out a lead  form</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Signed  up for an event</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– ”Liked” something </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Wrote a post on your wall (and more!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recommend expanding  this audience by creating a “Lookalike” custom audience in conjunction with this list, especially when your follower count is low. That way, Facebook will automatically show your ads to users that are most like your currently engaged merchants. </span></p>
<h4><strong>4. Offline Activity</strong></h4>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1257 size-large" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Offline-Activity-01.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the other advertising options  on Facebook, a custom audience based on offline activity is based on an API connection with your POS, CRM, marketing software, or other third party vendor. The data can also be exported from those services and uploaded manually to Facebook. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although receipt data isn’t useful for ISOs, information from your CRM is. With the offline activity targeting option, you can, for example, tell Facebook to show ads to merchants  just as they are becoming eligible for renewals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realize most ISOs probably don’t have the IT resources to set up the API connection, so if nothing else we recommend loading up this data manually.</span></p>
<h4>5. App Activity</h4>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1258 size-large" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/App-Activity-01.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is ranked least useful to ISOs not because it isn’t useful, but because most likely you don’t have your own app. With this option, advertisers are able to create ads that target users based on actions they take within their app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example:  if you have an app, you can target ads only to users who:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Downloaded your app but have not used it for 90 days</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Put a product in their shopping cart within the app but didn’t complete their purchase</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– And any other actions taken (or not taken) within your app</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ISOs like you are in constant contact with owners of small businesses across America each and every day. If you are like most ISOs, you probably know the ins and outs of all sorts of businesses. From food service, to lawn care, to home building, to hospitality supplies. But it’s important to understand where small business is trending towards as a whole, and not just on an individual level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing what experts predict to see in the coming year allows for you to plan your business model accordingly. If for instance you did not focus on women owned businesses in 2017, you may want to in 2018. Did you know women business owners are predicted to increase their investments by 29% in 2018? That is something you wouldn’t know from speaking to individual business owners. It sure helps plan how you approach leads in the coming year, though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our article “</span><a href="https://pearlcapital.com/mca-sales-tools/newsletters/removing-iso-marketing-randomness/"><b>Removing Randomness Will Make You A More Profitable ISO</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Mike Langford of</span><a href="http://www.finservmarketing.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> finServ Marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes “you should know what makes your target market tick, what are their problems” and “what are their goals.” That means keeping up with trends, knowing where industries are heading, and what you should anticipate to happen in the months to come. We hope these insights from the</span><a href="http://go.bizjournals.com/l/162121/2018-01-08/v5kt9"> <b>Biz Journals SMB Insights 2018</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help you plan for the coming year. If nothing else, they are interesting to take note of!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Women Small Business Owners Will Increase Investments</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1210 size-full" title="Women Small Business Personal Investments" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/women-personal-investments-01.jpg" alt="women-small-business-investments" width="2134" height="1067" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/women-personal-investments-01.jpg 2134w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/women-personal-investments-01-300x150.jpg 300w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/women-personal-investments-01-768x384.jpg 768w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/women-personal-investments-01-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/women-personal-investments-01-900x450.jpg 900w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/women-personal-investments-01-1200x600.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 2134px) 100vw, 2134px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women in positions of ownership at small businesses are predicted to increase personal investments at a higher rate than male business owners in 2018. ISOs who have found success in developing a</span><a href="https://pearlcapital.com/mca-sales-tools/iso-webinars/niche-marketing-for-isos/"> <b>niche market</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in women owned businesses take note! And if you haven&#8217;t thought about it before, consider targeting more woman merchants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">More Millennials In Business Management</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1211 size-full" title="Top Small Business Concerns" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Top-Business-Concerns-01-1.jpg" alt="top-business-concerns" width="2134" height="1067" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Top-Business-Concerns-01-1.jpg 2134w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Top-Business-Concerns-01-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Top-Business-Concerns-01-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Top-Business-Concerns-01-1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Top-Business-Concerns-01-1-900x450.jpg 900w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Top-Business-Concerns-01-1-1200x600.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 2134px) 100vw, 2134px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More millennials are predicted to be in management positions than ever before in 2018. That means a change in what businesses are most concerned about compared to previous years. That isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing for ISOs. 35% of millennials very concerned about accessing capital, business loans, or credit for their business. You very well could be the solution to their cash problem in 2018!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Small Business Owners Are More Optimistic Than Ever</h2>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1212 size-full" title="Small Business Optimism 2018" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Optimism-SMB-01-2.jpg" alt="small-business-optimism" width="2107" height="1067" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Optimism-SMB-01-2.jpg 2107w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Optimism-SMB-01-2-300x152.jpg 300w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Optimism-SMB-01-2-768x389.jpg 768w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Optimism-SMB-01-2-1024x519.jpg 1024w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Optimism-SMB-01-2-900x456.jpg 900w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Optimism-SMB-01-2-1200x608.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 2107px) 100vw, 2107px" /></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Federation of Independent Business Small Business data expects small to medium sized businesses to be more optimistic in 2018 than in recent years. What does this mean for you as an ISO? Confidence in their businesses means confidence in growth and in a profitable future. You can expect more businesses looking for capital to cover growth and expansion, marketing, advertising, and hiring.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Small Business Owners Will Invest More In Advertising Budgets</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1213 size-full" title="Small Business Advertising Budget" src="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/advertising-and-vehicles-01.jpg" alt="small-business-advertising" width="2134" height="1068" srcset="https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/advertising-and-vehicles-01.jpg 2134w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/advertising-and-vehicles-01-300x150.jpg 300w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/advertising-and-vehicles-01-768x384.jpg 768w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/advertising-and-vehicles-01-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/advertising-and-vehicles-01-900x450.jpg 900w, https://pearlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/advertising-and-vehicles-01-1200x601.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 2134px) 100vw, 2134px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the increased confidence in the success of their businesses, there will be an increase in ad budgets. In fact, the Business Journals SMB Insights report estimates that 13% of SMB owners have increased advertising budgets in 2018. That&#8217;s a good thing! More advertising budgets means more capital needed. While speaking with merchants, you may hear more than years prior the need for financing relating to email</span><a href="https://pearlcapital.com/mca-sales-tools/iso-guides/marketing-efforts-for-isos-infographic/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, social media advertising, and direct mail.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world of business financing is a saturated one. Small business owners are flooded with offers for financing from all different sources, all competing for their attention and interest. So, how do you cut through the clutter and be the first choice for financing? The answer could be referrals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that prospects are 4x more likely to buy when referred by someone they know? Or how about the fact that <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/nielsenglobal/apac/docs/reports/2015/nielsen-global-trust-in-advertising-report-september-2015.pdf">83% of prospects trust the recommendations of their friends</a>? These stats are true – and if you’re able to build a referral engine for your ISO business, you have got a head start over your competition. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out this infographic to learn just how important referrals are for your business as an ISO and when you&#8217;re finished, check out our webinar <a href="https://pearlcapital.com/mca-sales-tools/iso-webinars/create-steady-flow-referrals-iso-business-webinar/">&#8220;How to Create a Steady Flow of Referrals for Your ISO Business&#8221;</a>: </span></p>
